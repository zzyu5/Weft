# MOVES.md — org STAGE1 directory reorg (2026-07-06)

**Method**: all cell/doc relocations done with `git mv` (history preserved). Zero file loss:
tracked union `git ls-files experiments/ docs/` = **150 before → 150 after** the moves
(rename-preserving), then **+ new per-cell MANIFEST.md + this MOVES.md** (increase only).
Untracked-ignored scratch physically rode along with each `git mv`'d directory; ignore
patterns were re-anchored to the new paths (see "gitignore re-anchoring" below) so the same
files stay ignored — nothing exposed, nothing lost.

**Target structure** (裁决二): `experiments/{active,sealed,archive,_templates}/<campaign>/<cell>/`
and `docs/{canon,method,reports}/`.

### experiments/ cells
| campaign | tier | cells |
|---|---|---|
| repack | sealed/repack/ | rvv-SEALED-q4_0-vlen128-fullmarch, rvv-bringup-q4_0-vlen128, k1-vlen256-q4_0-flip, rvv-vlen128-q4_0-gemm-constructed-sealed, rvv-vlen128-q4_0-repack-genroute |

Stayed put at experiments/ top level: `README.md` (kept as experiments index — table→claim map), `MANIFEST.md` (rewritten thin), `.gitignore`.

---

## 2. Non-`git mv` operations (recorded explicitly)

| op | path | reason |
|---|---|---|
| **plain mv** (untracked, gitignored) | experiments/e2e-harness/results/rvv-vlen128-q4_0-gemm-constructed-redeploy/ → experiments/active/repack/… | whole dir is gitignored (0 tracked files); `git mv` cannot move it → plain `mv`. Physical move, no loss. |
| **plain mv + PRESERVE** (untracked, unref) | docs/TCRV_IR三层与编译器身份_docs常驻.md → docs/reports/2026-07-06-TCRV_IR三层与编译器身份_parallel-writer-leftover.md | Parallel-writer leftover, untracked, **zero external refs** (grep clean). Task said delete-if-unreferenced; **preserved instead** (renamed non-authoritative) to honor ★文件零丢失 — untracked ⇒ hard-delete is unrecoverable. **User: hard-delete if you truly want it gone.** |
| **rmdir** (empty) | experiments/e2e-harness/board/ , experiments/e2e-harness/results/ , experiments/e2e-harness/ | emptied after cell moves; empty untracked dirs, git tracks no dirs → zero loss. |
| **NOT FOUND** | docs/Untitled | task said delete the empty shell — **it does not exist** in the tree (nothing to do). |

## 3. gitignore re-anchoring (keep same scratch ignored at new paths)

| file | old pattern | new pattern |
|---|---|---|
| .gitignore (root) | experiments/ondevice-*/ | experiments/archive/perf-historical/ondevice-*/ |
| .gitignore (root) | (none) | scratch/ (added — target-structure gitignored diagnostics area) |
| experiments/.gitignore | e2e-harness/results/rvv-vlen128-q4_0-gemm-constructed-redeploy/ | active/repack/rvv-vlen128-q4_0-gemm-constructed-redeploy/ |

Effect: the 101 previously-ignored scratch files that briefly became untracked-not-ignored after the dir moves are re-ignored → `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard experiments/` = 0. Promoted tracked seals stay tracked (gitignore never affects already-tracked files).

## 4. New tracked files (the only permitted increase)

- `experiments/archive/MOVES.md` (this file)
- one `MANIFEST.md` per cell (see §6) + `experiments/_templates/MANIFEST.md` + `experiments/active/repack/MANIFEST.md`
- `experiments/MANIFEST.md` rewritten thin (same path; not a new file)

## 6. Per-cell MANIFEST split (STAGE1 step 5)

The old single-body `experiments/MANIFEST.md` REGISTRY was split into **one `MANIFEST.md` per cell**
(campaign + role + status + durable file list). Top-level `experiments/MANIFEST.md` is now a **thin index**
pointing at the per-cell manifests (STAGE2 INDEX.md may supersede it). Per-cell manifests written at:
sealed/repack/{5 cells}/, sealed/silicon/{3}/, sealed/c1-cleanliness/{2}/, active/visibility/, active/result-tables/,
active/e2e-harness/, active/repack/ (campaign-level, since the cell dir is gitignored), archive/perf-historical/{5}/, _templates/.

## 7. Harness abstraction (STAGE1 step 4) — already clean

No tracked harness/scripts remain in any cell: a prior commit (MANIFEST 2026-07-06 "harness 迁出" note) already
moved all protocol/driver/CI scripts to `tools/e2e-harness/` and `tools/lint/`. The only harness-shaped files left
in cells are **gitignored scratch** (`board_ab_q5k.sh`, `run_fair.sh`, `*_verify_driver.c`, `mirror_test`, build `.o/.cpp`)
that ride with their archive cell and stay ignored. Registered evidence-pointer code (`*.kernel.c`, `*.emitc.mlir`,
sealed `*.o`) intentionally **stays in-cell** per the data-cell contract.

## 8. ⚠ STAGE2 follow-ups (referrers that now DANGLE — NOT fixed here; out of STAGE1 mv scope)

These point at old paths and will break until STAGE2 rewires them. **Do not commit before addressing, or CI goes red.** The lint / tooling gate path-breaks below are **RESOLVED** (STAGE2, 裁决九 — reworked to per-cell manifests / sealed paths and CI-wired fail-closed); the schema/docs/spec reference-breaks that follow are still open:

- **[RESOLVED 裁决九] `tools/lint/check_manifest.py`** — was an exact-path pin vs the single top-MANIFEST REGISTRY. Reworked; parses the thin (empty) REGISTRY block without crashing, exit 0.
- **[RESOLVED 裁决九] `tools/lint/check_experiments_data_only.py`** — superseded by `check_experiments_layout.py` (per-cell registered-artifact-pointer lookup); exit 0.
- **[RESOLVED 裁决九] `tools/lint/check_opponent_facts_pin.sh:26`** — now points at `experiments/sealed/c1-cleanliness/opponent-facts-provenance/opponent-facts.pin.json`; CI-wired in `.github/workflows/falsifier-gate.yml` (job `opponent-facts-pin`), exit 0.
- **[RESOLVED 裁决九] `tools/visibility/`** (gen_sixstate_table.py, gen_burndown_curve.py, recompute_ledger_anchor.sh, regen_all.sh, check_visibility_drift.py) — retargeted to `experiments/active/visibility/`; `check_visibility_drift.py:101` now asserts `endswith("experiments/active/visibility")`.
- **`tools/e2e-harness/run_e2e.sh:17`** (`RESULTS_ROOT=…/experiments/e2e-harness/results`) and **silicon-validation-batch-1/2/gemm run_*.sh** (`CELL=…/experiments/silicon-validation-*`) — future re-runs write to old paths.
- **`schema/pattern-registry.v1.json`** lines 75/85/88 — `experiments/ondevice-q8_0-deferred/fair/perf_rvv_vlen128_FAIR.csv`, `experiments/perf-characterizations-layer4.md`, `experiments/ondevice-q5_K/` (now archive/perf-historical/ + docs/method/).
- **`schema/coverage-sixstate.v1.json`** lines 112/121/130/151/166/391 — `experiments/silicon-validation-batch-1|2` (now sealed/silicon/).
- **`docs/canon/TianChen-RV_执行总纲v2.md`** — `experiments/perf-characterizations-layer4.md` (→ docs/method/), `experiments/T8_winloss_gap_ledger.csv` (→ active/result-tables/); also a pre-existing stale ref to `experiments/T3_step3/board_ab.sh` (that script already lives in tools/).
- **`docs/reports/2026-07-06-T3-…` / `-T6-…` templates** — reference silicon + e2e cell paths (self-contained agent reports; low priority).
- **`.trellis/spec/…` + `.trellis/tasks/…`** — T-N / visibility / ondevice / T3_step3 path refs (spec refs are by-reference, archived-task refs are historical; low priority).

## 9. VC-retirement: 5 tracked `.o` build artifacts moved out of version control (必问 batch ⑤, 2026-07-11 user ruling)

**Decision (user-ruled)**: build artifacts do not belong in git. The 5 tracked `.o` under
`experiments/archive/perf-historical/` are STALE cross-compiled/on-device perf binaries (pre-board-swap,
not comparable) that only inflate the repo; they are retired from version control (reconstructible).

**Where this is registered**: HERE, in the file-lifecycle ledger (MOVES.md). NOT in
`schema/retired-index.generated.json` — that machine-generated RETIRED-INDEX is scoped to **quant-format
op/emitter retirements** (axis ∈ {vec_dot monolith op-def, gemm_tile repack direct-emitter}); a build-`.o`
artifact has no such axis and adding one would break `check_retired_index.py` coverage. MOVES.md is the
correct home for physical file lifecycle events (moves + VC-retirements).

**Four/five requirements (per the RETIRED-INDEX四要件 shape)**:

| # | 格名 (format) | op (files) | 退役依据 (basis) | 替代路径 (alternative) | 复原指针 (restore_ref) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `.o` build artifact | `perf-historical/ondevice-q8_0-deferred/A_deferred.o` | 构建产物不入 VC + STALE perf (换板前不可比) | 可重建 (clang re-emit from cell `.kernel.c`/`.emitc.mlir`); MOVES §5 move-record #56 | `git show b3e3fef4:<path>` (also any pre-rm commit incl. aeed7e0b) |
| 2 | `.o` build artifact | `perf-historical/ondevice-q8_0/kernel_q8_0_q8_0_flat_block_dot.o` | 同上 | 可重建; MOVES §5 move-record #70 | `git show b3e3fef4:<path>` |
| 3 | `.o` build artifact | `perf-historical/ondevice-q8_0-mbf/kernel_core_mbf2.o` | 同上 | 可重建; MOVES §5 move-record #59 | `git show b3e3fef4:<path>` |
| 4 | `.o` build artifact | `perf-historical/ondevice-q8_0-mbf/kernel_ggml_factory.o` | 同上 | 可重建; MOVES §5 move-record #60 | `git show b3e3fef4:<path>` |
| 5 | `.o` build artifact | `perf-historical/ondevice-q8_0-mbf/kernel_q8_mbf1.o` | 同上 | 可重建; MOVES §5 move-record #61 | `git show b3e3fef4:<path>` |

**★承重引用核查 (确认无 load-bearing 引用 → 批准移除)**:
- `docs/reports/SEALED-WIN-REGISTRY.md`: **0 refs** to any of the 5 `.o`.
- casefiles / `*.casefile`: **0 refs**.
- MANIFEST (`experiments/active/t3p-pattern-ablation/MANIFEST.md`): references the sibling `perf_rvv_vlen128_FAIR.csv` **only** — NOT any `.o` (the `.csv` is NOT being removed).
- Non-load-bearing descriptive refs that DO exist (safe): `experiments/INDEX.md` (auto-gen inventory column), this MOVES.md (move-records + this section), and one archived task diagnosis note
  (`.trellis/tasks/archive/2026-07/07-03-m-flat-s5a1-perblock-load/research/skeleton-vsetvli-diagnosis-2a.md`) that cites the **pre-MOVE** path as the objdump source for a vsetvli-count table — the actual counts (19/15) are already transcribed in that markdown, the binary was only the raw source.
- b3e3fef4 confirmed to contain all 5 `.o` (restore reproducible).

**Downstream consistency (for the main session that executes `git rm`)**: after removing the `.o`, the
per-cell MANIFESTs still register them, so `check_index_consistency` (per-cell drift) will flag
"registered but MISSING" until the MANIFESTs drop them and `experiments/INDEX.md` is regenerated. The
full recipe is in the task hand-off (git rm + 3 MANIFEST edits + gen_experiments_index.py + optional
`.gitignore`). This section (a tier-root doc, exempt from per-cell drift) does NOT itself affect the gate.

- **Tasks 归档**: 36 个 `.trellis/tasks/*` → `.trellis/tasks/archive/2026-07/` (全部已被 G5/G6/G7/改名超越·仅保 `07-02-full-refactor` 母 program + `archive/`)。含 manifest D 列 26 + 未列 10 (`07-07-dir-hygiene-lints-ci-clean-red`/`07-07-fix-blockdot-zfh-packager`/`07-07-line-A-board`/`07-07-line-D-evidence`/`07-07-retire-q1_0-monolith`/`07-07-retire-residual-gate-whitelist`/`07-07-wire-opponent-facts-pin-ci`/`07-08-G3-frontdoor`/`07-09-G3-e2e-seal`/`07-09-G3-minterm-fix`·均 pre-G8 07-07~09 超越·为过 gate#4 一并归档)。
- **Delete (6 空 header 模板·零 filled·git 可复原)**: `_templates/{T1c_external_reproduction,T1d_dual_instance_same_schema,T3m_migration_criterion,T5a_ime_structural_corroboration,T5c_crossover_selector_calibration,T5d_ime_vendor_path_methodology}.csv`。de-listed from `_templates/MANIFEST.md` (16→10) + `experiments/README.md` 表映射 (T5a..d 行收窄为 T5b)。§11.2 上方 §7/§10 及本节 src→dst 历史行留档 (append-only)。

### 11.4 Repoint (移动前解引用·避断链)

- `result-tables/T8_winloss_gap_ledger.csv` + `result-tables/T3_B_board_B_rvv1.0_vlen256.csv` + `docs/reports/2026-07-07-small-m-decode-reuse-scout.md`: `experiments/active/p1-k1-vlen256-decode-roofline` → `experiments/archive/perf-historical/p1-k1-vlen256-decode-roofline`。
- `active/vlen-adapt/vl16_static_account.md` (SEALED-WIN#1 承重) + `docs/reports/2026-07-11-TEMPLATE-AUDIT-structure.md`: `experiments/active/rvv-e2e-m1` → `experiments/archive/rvv-e2e/rvv-e2e-m1`。
- `experiments/.gitignore`: `active/repack/rvv-vlen128-...redeploy/` → `archive/parked/repack/rvv-vlen128-...redeploy/` (deploy 工件维持 untracked·check-ignore 已验)。

**残留 stale 证据指针 (非断链·MOVES 本表即重定向图)**: 其它 archived cell (g5-wiring/kquant-*/line-c-k1-strike/g4-*/t4b-* 等) 在 T8/T3/docs 中的 `experiments/active/<cell>` 证据指针**未逐一 mass-repoint** (manifest repoint 域仅 p1 + rvv-e2e-m1·账本本体保护·且无 lint/recon 消费这些字符串)。任一指针经本节 §11.2 桶映射即可重定向 (`active/<cell>` → `archive/<桶>/<cell>`)。
