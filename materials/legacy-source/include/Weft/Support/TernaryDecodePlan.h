//===- TernaryDecodePlan.h - Ternary dequant decode plan -----------------===//
//
// The DequantMechanismPlan abstraction's FIFTH (and last) landed mechanism (phase-4,
// family #5): the base-3 / delta ternary family (iq1_s / iq1_m / tq1_0 / tq2_0)
// dequant-row DECODE plan.
//
// A TernaryDecodePlan is the transient C++ compile-period object the RVV plugin's dequant
// family-local construction formula (`constructTernaryDecodePlan`) produces from the
// stamped decode_core descriptor facts, and the dequant-row ternary
// EMITTER (emitDequantizeRowTernaryDecodeBodyShared) reads plan.* INSTEAD of dispatching on
// the decode_model string. Format names lose ALL dispatch power: the plan's `mechanism` tag
// routes the ternary family (the dispatch tests plan.mechanism == TernaryDecode, NOT the
// format string), the `leaf` field selects the per-format owned real-vector body,
// `entryLanes` carries the grid ENTRY byte-width g-axis geometry for the iq1 grid leaves
// (律2), and `provenanceFormat` is diagnostic ONLY.
//
// SPLITTING TERNARY OUT OF THE DOUBLE-HEADED GridDecodePlan (audit finding, [K-10]
// restoration). The GridDecodePlan REGISTRY (GridDecodePlan.cpp) LUMPS the ternary iq1_s /
// iq1_m rows in WITH the grid rows via GridFoldArith::TernaryDelta / DeltaGrid /
// DeltaGridGroupSum -- a [K-10] violation (grid and ternary are structurally distinct
// mechanisms). This plan gives ternary its OWN mechanism tag (TernaryDecode) and its OWN
// struct, distinct from GridLookupPlan, and -- unlike GridLookupPlan -- it does NOT consult
// lookupGridDecodePlan at all: ternary is a SEPARATE mechanism, and tq1_0/tq2_0 are not even
// grid-registry rows (they are pure-arithmetic base-3 / 2-bit ternary super-blocks). So for
// the dequant-row head, grid != ternary is RESTORED: grid consults the grid registry,
// ternary does not, and the two ride two separate plans. The GridDecodePlan registry's own
// lumping (iq1_s/iq1_m's TernaryDelta/DeltaGrid rows) serves the block-dot VERIFIER + repack
// emitters and is left UNTOUCHED (that is the vec_dot/block-dot path, ISSUE-122 deferred).
//
// [K-10] (STRUCTURAL vs PARAMETRIC). The five dequant decode mechanisms
// (NibbleDecode / KQuantScaleMin / CodebookGather / GridLookup / TernaryDecode) differ in
// data-consumption contract and iteration topology, so each is a STRUCTURALLY distinct
// mechanism and gets its OWN plan struct -- they are NOT collapsed into one plan the emitter
// switches on by a `mechanism` discriminant (that is the "structural axis as a knob" the
// GEMM/GEMV rulings forbid). TernaryDecodePlan is the TernaryDecode mechanism ONLY; its
// `mechanism` field is a STRUCTURAL TAG that is always TernaryDecode (asserted, never
// switched-on to reach a different mechanism's body). The FOUR ternary formats realize the
// SAME mechanism -- a {-1, 0, 1} ternary weight decoded (by a signed grid gather for the
// iq1 leaves, by pure base-3 / 2-bit arithmetic for the tq leaves) and scaled -- so `leaf`
// selects among the FOUR ALREADY-SEPARATE owned real-vector bodies (the shared tq1_0/tq2_0
// arithmetic body keyed by which base, the iq1_m per-group-delta body, the iq1_s
// per-sub-block-delta body), a leaf SELECTION sanctioned by [K-10]. `entryLanes` is the
// PARAMETRIC (g-axis) geometry the phase-1 律2 migration retired into the descriptor for the
// iq1 grid leaves; the tq leaves carry no grid entry.
//
// This header lives in Support because WeftRVVDialect (the verifier) and WeftConversionRVV
// (the emitter) both link it, and Conversion -> Dialect is the only legal direction between
// those two -- the SAME siting rule GridDecodePlan.h / NibbleDecodePlan.h /
// CodebookGatherPlan.h / KQuantScaleMinPlan.h / GridLookupPlan.h record. The plan is a
// transient plugin-internal C++ object; it MUST NOT be lifted into any cross-ABI
// ExtensionPlugin boundary struct ([P-1] quasi-ABI). The closed DequantMechanism taxonomy is
// shared from NibbleDecodePlan.h (the first landed mechanism's home); this header REUSES it,
// it does not redefine it.
